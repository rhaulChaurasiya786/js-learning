# How JS works

## "Everythings in js happens inside an Execution context"
- Execution context have two componet 
(1) Memory component (memory creation phase,variable environment)
(2) Code component (Code execution phase,thread of execution)

## "JS is synchronous single-threaded language"
- JS can only run one command at a time and in specific order, Taht mean it can only go to next line once current line execution is finished.
